A recent study shows no matter where you live Toronto or Shanghai, more than 90% of children under 12 years old participate any sorts of extra curriculum activities. Chinese parents are more or less the same even if the education system and philosophy is somewhat different in Canada and China.

Not surprisingly to most who lives in Toronto, Kids on average take 5 extra curriculum activities more so than those in Shanghai. While kids in Shanghai taking Maths and English, Kids in Toronto doing more sports, arts and more recreational activities. Academic pressure for kids before 12 in Toronto definitely not as much as in Shanghai.
